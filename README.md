## Implementing/Running Force Graph Visualisation: 
This visualisation program can be executed by running index.html file in either Internet Explorer, Firefox or Chrome web-browsers. It's recommended for optimal experience that Firefox is used. As the program was primiarly tested using this web environment. 


Alternatively the file could be launched from using Brackets text editor with the built in Live Preview function. However, this function has caused issues when testing the program and isn't consistent with the results. Thus, it's advised if it can be avoided to not execute this program using Brackets.

## Important 
This interactive visualisation was built and tested on a browser size of 1366 x 695, thus, for optimal experience please adjust the web browser dimensions to 1366 x 695.
